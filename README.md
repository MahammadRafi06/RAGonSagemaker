# RAGwithSagemaker

## Overview

This project demonstrates a Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline implemented using SageMaker. It leverages external data sources (OpenFDA and PubChem - based on previous context), a SageMaker-deployed embedding model (likely a HuggingFace model), a SageMaker-deployed Large Language Model (LLM) (Llama 2), and MongoDB Atlas for vector storage. The application is likely served using Flask or Streamlit.

This repository contains the necessary code and configurations to build and deploy this RAG system on AWS SageMaker.

**Key Files and Directories:**

* `RAGwithSagemaker/`: Contains the main project code organized into modules for components, configuration, pipelines, entities, utilities, cloud interactions, exceptions, and logging.
* `RAGwithSagemaker/config/`: Holds configuration files (`config.yaml`) and the configuration management logic (`configuration.py`).
* `RAGwithSagemaker/pipeline/`: Likely contains the implementation of the RAG pipeline stages.
* `RAGwithSagemaker/entity/`: Defines data structures and configuration entities.
* `RAGwithSagemaker/utils/`: Includes common utility functions (`common.py`).
* `Data/`: Intended for storing project-related data.
* `.github/workflows/`: Contains CI/CD workflow definitions (currently `.gitkeep`).
* `Dockerfile`: Defines the Docker image for the application.
* `main.py`: The main entry point for the application.
* `params.yaml`: Stores parameters used in the project.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies.
* `research/research.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook likely used for experimentation and research.
* `schema.yaml`: Defines the schema for data or configurations.
* `setup.py`: Used for packaging and installing the project.
* `config/config.yaml`: Another configuration file (likely a duplicate or for specific configurations).

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd RAGwithSagemaker
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/macOS
    .\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
    ```

3.  **Install the dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Create a `.env` file (if needed) in the project root and define any necessary environment variables (e.g., MongoDB connection string, SageMaker endpoint names, API keys). You might need to refer to the `config/configuration.py` or other parts of the codebase to identify the required environment variables.

## Configuration

The project uses YAML configuration files (`config/config.yaml` and `params.yaml`) for managing settings. Update these files as needed for your specific setup, such as data paths, model parameters, and SageMaker endpoint configurations.

## Running the Application

The `main.py` file likely serves as the entry point for running the application. You can execute it using:

```bash
python main.py
Refer to the code within main.py to understand the specific execution steps and any command-line arguments it might accept.

Deployment to SageMaker
The project is designed to leverage SageMaker for deploying the embedding model and the LLM. The deployment process likely involves:

Creating SageMaker Endpoints: Using the AWS SageMaker SDK or console to deploy the pre-trained embedding model (e.g., from HuggingFace) and the Llama 2 model.
Configuring Endpoint Names: Ensuring that the SageMaker endpoint names are correctly configured in the project's configuration files (config.yaml or params.yaml) or environment variables.
Building and Pushing Docker Image (if necessary): If custom inference logic is required, a Docker image containing the necessary dependencies and code needs to be built and pushed to Amazon ECR.
Refer to the code in RAGwithSagemaker/cloud/ (if it exists) and the configuration files for details on SageMaker deployment.

Data Ingestion and Processing
The RAG pipeline ingests data from OpenFDA and PubChem (based on previous context). The data ingestion and processing logic would be implemented within the RAGwithSagemaker/pipeline/ or RAGwithSagemaker/components/ directories. This likely involves:

Downloading data from the sources.
Preprocessing and cleaning the data.
Generating vector embeddings using the deployed SageMaker embedding model.
Storing the embeddings in MongoDB Atlas.
RAG Pipeline
The core RAG pipeline likely resides in the RAGwithSagemaker/pipeline/ directory. It orchestrates the following steps:

Receiving user queries from the Flask/Streamlit application.
Retrieving relevant vector embeddings from MongoDB Atlas based on the query.
Formulating a prompt for the SageMaker-deployed LLM, including the retrieved context and the user query.
Receiving the generated response from the LLM.
Returning the response to the user interface.
